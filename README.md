## RUN!!

For the final project, Run!, I'm excited to see how everything I’ve learned so far comes together. This project builds on the skills I’ve been developing, and it feels like the culmination of all the foundational work.
"Run!" is a fast-paced, endless runner game where the player navigates obstacles while attempting to survive as long as possible. This project pushes my understanding of game mechanics, object management, and performance, all while using the SFML library.

Key aspects of the Run! project:

<span style="color: red;">**Dynamic Obstacle Generation**</span>: I’ll be generating obstacles dynamically as the game progresses, which involves managing object pools efficiently to ensure performance doesn’t degrade as the game speeds up.
**Speed and Difficulty Scaling**: One of the core mechanics in this project is the gradual increase in difficulty, with obstacles appearing more frequently and moving faster. This introduces the concept of balancing game difficulty, which is crucial in designing engaging and challenging games.
**Collision Detection and Player Movement**: The player must navigate through gaps in the obstacles, so precise collision detection will be vital. I’ll also refine the player movement system to ensure it feels responsive and fluid, key to any runner game’s gameplay experience.
**Scorekeeping and High Scores**: Implementing a scoring system based on how long the player survives will help solidify my understanding of game state management and displaying dynamic information on the screen.
This project is where I’ll also be focusing on code organization and optimization. Given the fast-paced nature of the game, maintaining smooth performance is critical, especially as the number of objects increases on screen. I’ll continue applying memory management techniques learned from previous projects to keep things running efficiently.

With Run!, I’m ready to apply all my knowledge and push my limits. This project marks an important milestone in my journey, and as I complete it, I’ll be that much closer to my ultimate goal of diving into Unreal Engine and creating even more complex games.

The thrill of seeing everything come together in a polished final project like this is incredibly motivating!

## SFML Library
Throughout these projects, I used the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), which is a cross-platform library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components in C++. SFML is particularly useful for game development due to its simplicity and ease of use.

**Key Features**:
- **Graphics**: Rendering shapes, sprites, and text. SFML makes it easy to draw 2D graphics and handle basic animations.
- **Windowing**: Creating and managing game windows. SFML provides a straightforward way to create windows and handle events such as resizing and closing.
- **Audio**: Playing sound effects and music. SFML supports various audio formats and allows for easy playback and control of sounds.
- **Input**: Handling keyboard, mouse, and joystick input. SFML simplifies the process of capturing and responding to user inputs.

SFML has been a great starting point for learning the basics of game programming. It handles many of the lower-level tasks like rendering, input management, and audio playback, which allowed me to focus on learning game logic and design. Through each project, I explored new features of SFML and honed my C++ skills.


## What next
As I'm currently studying at 42 London and aiming to dive deeper into game development, these foundational projects are giving me the confidence to move on to more advanced engines like Unreal Engine. By starting with simpler projects, I’ve built a strong understanding of the game development process, which will be crucial as I transition to working with 3D environments and more complex mechanics.

The gaming industry is something I'm truly passionate about, and I can’t wait to take what I’ve learned here and apply it to bigger, more ambitious projects. These early experiences are essential building blocks, and I feel ready to take on more advanced challenges!
